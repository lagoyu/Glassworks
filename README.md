Code quality teaching materials
The Master is an example of poor quality code. It runs, but the code is of low quality.

Students should consider how to improve:
* Indentation
* Avoiding repeated code
* Improving identifiers of variables & methods
* Avoiding magic numbers
* Bugs in the algorithm used for calculation

Branches show different levels of improvement

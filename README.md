Code quality teaching materials
This is an example of poor quality code. It runs, but the code is of low quality.
Students should consider how to improve:
* Indentation
* Avoiding repeated code
* Improving identifiers of variables & methods
* Avoiding magic numbers
* Bugs in the algorithm used for calculation
